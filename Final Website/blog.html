						<p class="rightside">They did a fantastic job on Vader! Vader was well rested and had plenty of play time. He thoroughly enjoyed staying over at Doggy Daycare & Retreat and I could tell he wanted to stay for as long as he could</p>

						<p class="leftside">Wesley was very well groomed, but we had to wait for a long time after our scheduled appointment. They seemed like they had too much going on at once, but overall it was a great experience. They were very friendly and treated my dog with care.</p>

						<p class="rightside">Absolutely horrible service. My dog, Reddik, did not get along with any of the other dogs and they just let him get attacked. They told me to come pick him up early which put a lot of my plans in jeopardy. After arrival they said that "he was the problem" and "he kept attacking everyone." This can't be true, I could never believe that my precious dog would attack anyone.</p>
