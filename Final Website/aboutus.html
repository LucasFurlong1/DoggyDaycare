						<p class="rightside">Our names are Erik and Julia Scottsdale! We have lived together, married, in Muskegon for about 10 years. We have been together for almost 20!</p>
						<p class="rightside">We met in highschool our senior year and Juilia went to Davenport and Erik went to Grand Valley both for a bachelors in Business Administration. We have both struggled to find a job we both like and manage together
						with our very diverse opinions on managing a business. So, we combined our love for dogs and owning a business and we started a dog day care right out of our house!</p>
						<p class="rightside">Our mission statement is to make sure all dogs are treated like royalty whenever they are in our care!</p>

						<p class="leftside">We have always had a love for animals. We have both collectively owned animals for 40 years! We even just recently got a Shiba-Inu and her name is Marmalade.</p>
						<p class="leftside">We both started this business in 2015 and it has been booming ever sense! We started out doing only doggy day care, but eventually we thought about expanding our business. In 2017 we added an addition to our house to help house and groom dogs!
						This grooming and housing room helped us implement some new services and help expand our ever-growing company!</p>
